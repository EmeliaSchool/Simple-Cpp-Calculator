Simple C++ calculator that I made because I was bored. Is it the most efficient? No. Should you use this over something like, say, Galculator? Probably not. But, regardless, I was bored, so I made this. It's fine, it's not great, but it's fine. I'll keep improving it, and maybe someday I'll even add in a GUI and make it an actually usable calculator. For now, though, it's just for me to mess about with C++ as I learn it. 

If you want to download and use it for some reason, feel free to. You can also modify and redistribute it as you wish, though I'd prefer if you didn't sell it. You can download the compiled Linux binary from the releases page, or you can download the source code from the main repository and compile it yourself. I use G++, but you can use whatever you want, so long as it works.
